# BFVM - The overengineered brainfuck compiler tool

# Why?
just learning about some codegen stuff

# Why so pathetic?
The whole concept **is** pathetic. This is project is meant to be very
pathetic. So, if you can't tolerate this level of pathetic projects, run away.

# How to use it?

If you want to use the compiler, go to mfbc, and then run `cargo build`.
Then run the compiler and put brainfuck file. It'll spit c code. TBH, there's no optimizer.

If you want to use the bfvm tool, check mfbc source code to learn how to use this pathetic thing.
